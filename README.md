# ConcurrentSnakeGameWithBuffer
Concurrent snake game with a buffer
Welcome to the source code for Snake Game.

This was the work of a collaboration of five people that took over four months to complete. Over this time, we went over many different iterations and implementations of the snake game. This was submitted as a course assignment at the end of the semester.

This game was made with the intention of programming a proof of concept showing that it is possible to make a game which can have over 100 players (utilising concurrent threads) playing over a network without any noticeable lag.  We believe we have managed to achieve this requirement and more. 

Disclaimer: All controls and other documentation were in the files included in the submission, but have since been removed from this repository for the sake of anonymity. Additionally, this build has not been polished and is not user friendly in any way. Use at your own risk.
